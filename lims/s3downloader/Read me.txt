Working Principle
1. Python must be setup on user's machine
2. requirements.txt --> Includes python packages necessary for running the s3 downloader successfully
3. encrypt_config_keys.py --> Note: DO NOT EXPORT THIS FILE TO USER'S PC
	For a new AWS key, 
	1. make the ENCRYPTION_KEY = b'' and run the encrypt_config_keys.py. output will be the ENCRYPTION_KEY, something like b'aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ1234567890=' (this is just example 		ENCRYPTION_KEY, your key will differ). Edit encrypt_config_keys.py and replace this value for the ENCRYPTION_KEY.
	2. This (ENCRYPTION_KEY) will be System Environment variable (S3_DOWNLOADER_ENCRYPTION_KEY).
	3. Run the encrypt_config_keys.py again. Now, input the AWS ACCESS KEY and AWS SECRETE ACCESS KEY. The output will be your ENCRYPTED_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID 						& ENCRYPTED_AWS_SECRETE_ACCESS_KEY. Input these values into config.json into respective fields.
4. config.json --> Configurable fields for S3bucket Encrypted Accession keys and s3 bucket paths to download from and user pc full path. You can configure multiple paths to scan from. Make 	sure the local_full_path exists on user's machine. Fields & their description:
	1. ENCRYPTED_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
	2. ENCRYPTED_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
	3. AWS_S3_REGION_NAME
	4. POLLING_INTERVAL_SECONDS --> Value in seconds. e.g: 300 = 5 mintues. Change accordingly
	5. DOWNLOAD_PATHS --> Add key value pairs to scan from multiple paths.
		5a. s3_bucket --> Just the bucket Name (e.g: "gulfdev")
		5b. s3_prefix --> s3 path without the bucket name (e.g: "labels/ddfiles/cassette/")
		5c. local_full_path --> Complete Path on user's Machine for files to be dowloaded ("C:/Users/vijay/Desktop/S3Downloads/cassette_labels")

5. s3_downloader.py --> This is the script file responsible for downloading the files from s3.
6. run_s3downloader_script.bat --> Batch file that executes s3_downloader.py. Make sure path to python.exe is updated for each user. After setup, just run this bat file.
